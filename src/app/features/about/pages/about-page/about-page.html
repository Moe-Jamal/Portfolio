          I’m Mohamed Jamal, a Front-End Developer and designer from Egypt, passionate about
          creating web experiences that are both beautiful and functional. I specialize in Angular,
          Vue, Nuxt, and modern web technologies to deliver scalable and responsive applications
          with clean, maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          My work focuses on bridging the gap between design and development—turning ideas into
          interactive interfaces that are intuitive and engaging. I care about performance,
          accessibility, and smooth animations to make every user interaction enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Beyond coding, I love learning new technologies, exploring UI/UX trends, and experimenting
          with creative solutions. I also enjoy learning languages and understanding cultures, which
          inspires my approach to design and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I’m looking to contribute to innovative projects within forward-thinking teams where I can
          combine my technical skills, creativity, and continuous drive to improve and grow.
